# CREATING-A-NEW-OPERATING-SYSTEM
Hello, i just arrived here and my nature impose to myself to go for the greatest goal. I just googled "how to create an operating system" ( i mean a new one, built from scratch that will work with new devices built differently from what we have today. So... i have no skills or competence to do it for now, since i just started learning something. But i know you guys have it. What I have is some madness and a lot of courage. But... why creating a completely new OS? because i fell that having something really ours would be a great thing!!! I mean, the hand of the system is everywhere ( i know.. writing this through my windows pc is part of the system, but i can'd do it in another way). SO let's assume we  create  a new operating system and new devices. It will be epic and always in the history!!!
