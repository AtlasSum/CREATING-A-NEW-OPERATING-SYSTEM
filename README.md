# CREATING-A-NEW-OPERATING-SYSTEM
Hello, i just arrived here and my nature impose to myself to go for the greatest goal. I just googled "how to create an operating system" ( i mean a new one, built from scratch that will work with new devices built differently from what we have today. So... i have no skills or competence to do it for now, since i just started learning something. But i know you guys have it. What I have is some madness and a lot of courage. But... why creating a completely new OS? because i fell that having something really ours would be a great thing!!! I mean, the hand of the system is everywhere ( i know.. writing this through my windows pc is part of the system, but i can'd do it in another way). SO let's assume we  create  a new operating system and new devices. It will be epic and always in the history!!! 
So... i don't know what is needed to do to create a new OS, but my dream is to create an alternative reality to the one we have today. Let me explain: there are colossus of technology that do what they do. My idea is to gather the right people to create (for example) new smartphones, or new devices in general that works with our new operating system. (then we will decide the name LoL). Just imagine that you helped create this and normal people start to create a new world using it!! it would be an historical event!!
Thanks in advance to evryone that will participate
May the force be with you
